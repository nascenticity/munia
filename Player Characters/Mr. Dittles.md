| The Power of Deduction | Investigate | Once per scene you can spend a fate point (and a few minutes of observation) to make a special investigate roll representing your potent deductive faculties                                                                                                         |
| Okay, Fine!            | Provoke     | You can use Provoke in place of Empathy to learn a target's aspects, by bullying them until they reveal one to you. The target defends against this with Will. (If the GM thinks the aspect is particularly vulnerable to your hostile approach, you get a +2 bonus) |
