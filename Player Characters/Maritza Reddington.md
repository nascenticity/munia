| Danger Sense      | Notice (any)                   | You have an almost preternatural capacity for detecting danger. Your Notice skill works unimpeded by conditions like total concealment, darkness, or other sensory impairments in situations where someone or something intends to harm you. |
| Always a Way Out  | Burglary (create an advantage) | +2 on burglary rolls made to create an advantage whenever you're trying to escape from a location                                                                                                                                            |
| Lies upon Lies    | Deceive (create an advantage)  | +2 to create a Deceive advantage against someone who has believed one of your lies already during this session.                                                                                                                              |
| Quick on the Draw | Shoot                          | You can use Shoot instead of Notice to determine turn order in any physical conflict where shooting quickly would be useful.                                                                                                                 |
