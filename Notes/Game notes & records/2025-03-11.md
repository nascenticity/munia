# Prep
- its been a week - in Towns End, the mines are still overrun with elementals an operations have stopped. ask players what their characters have been up to in the meantime
	- myla is probably sad about not having access to the mines
	- maritza is a wild card - what's keeping her in this town? or has she left? the others would almost certainly follow
	- has mr. dittles been trying to locate the airship? where IS the airship?
- - new events - someone sent to the nearest major city (Naven) for help, and just enough time has passed that some mages have arrived to assist with the Situation. Probably connected with [St. Pigeonation’s magic school](../../Factions/St.%20Pigeonation’s%20magic%20school.md); or official gov't representatives. They have a banishment ritual to perform, and the players can get involved in a couple different ways:
	- defend the mages while they perform a ritual (fight waves of enemies till a timer completes - pie chart/clock w/ 6 segments, progresses when a round passes w/o mages taking damage) 
	- give the mages information about what they observed while escaping the mines
	- assist the mages by finding ritual components in the nearby wilderness - four-segment clock, allow player contribution about what they think the components are?
- if characters have left town - why? if maritza leaves then likely the others follow, but it might be more fun to roleplay the encounter between the pcs & airship crew - if players are insistent about pursuing this scenario, then the story resumes shortly after where the last session ended.
- end of session is most likely a Significant Milestone.

> [!NOTE]
> ## Significant Milestones[](https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/advancement-change#significant-milestones)
> 
> Significant milestones usually occur at the end of a scenario or the conclusion of a big plot event (or, when in doubt, at the end of every two or three sessions). Unlike minor milestones, which are primarily about change, significant milestones are about learning new things—dealing with problems and challenges has made your character generally more capable at what they do.
> 
> In addition to the benefit of a minor milestone, you also gain both of the following:
> 
> - One additional skill point, which you can spend to buy a new skill at Average (+1) or increase an existing skill by one rank.
> - If you have any severe consequences, you can rename them to begin the recovery process, if you haven’t already.
> 
> When you spend your skill point, it’s worth one step on the ladder. You can use it to buy a new skill at Average (+1), or you can use it to increase an existing skill by one step on the ladder—say, from Good (+3) to Great (+4).
