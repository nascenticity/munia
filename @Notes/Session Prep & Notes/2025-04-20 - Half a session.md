# Prep

## Potential compels: 
- Mr. Dittles: Prone to chronic stress & too hardcore - compel him to overwork, or to be stressed out?
- Maritza: Pirate Queen mom; trying to turn over a new feather - compel her to make difficult parenting decisions, and to **NOT act if an action would be too much like the old her**
- Myla: toxic positivity; Crystals make her impulsive; fuming about the fumes 
- also invoke any Consequences that haven't fully resolved
	- Maritza - loss of confidence due to missing tail-feathers/torn cloak?
	- Myla - cracked carapace - temporary repairs make it stronger for now, but maybe **inhibit movement at some key moment**?

Other ideas:
- first aid kit = spend 1 fate point to add a +2 bonus to or re-roll any recovery action -- technically just the same as an aspect but more formalized
## Where we left off:
- The party had just ended a conflict with five earth elementals. Mr. Dittles, taking on the creatures' shape, snuck into the mines where he saw elementals using the place as a den, and found a mysterious portal to Somewhere Else.
- Many consequences were taken during the fight - Maritza lost her tail-feathers and her designer cloak; Myla got a cracked carapace and needs to repair her pickax; Mr. Dittles got hit in the face. Some recovery actions were taken.

## What's next:
- resolve any minor consequences that were Overcome last session
- allow for more Recovery actions if they have not been taken - esp. if group agrees to reconvene at the airship
- advantages/boosts left over from last time:
	- Myla made a rocket launcher
	- lightweight launcher (Myla's improvements to the rocket launcher)
	- High explosives (Maritza's grenades)
	- Strength of the Shell Splint (Myla's boost from recovery action)
	- advantage/aspect: first aid kit (everyone)
		- [ ] ENEMY gets a free invoke!
	- now you're thinking with portals (Mr. Dittles, saw the elemental portal in the cave)
		- [ ] free invoke 1
		- [ ] free invoke 2
- does Myla need to visit the blacksmith? Make an NPC
- how do the creatures inside the cave react to the loss of their comrades?
	- returning, they might see a few smaller elementals examining the remains of the ones they fought
	- if enough time has passed, there will be new elemental guardians outside the entrance. the remains have not been moved.
	- is there a back entrance? myla or one of the locals would probably know
		- the abandoned mine from quiet year that the village started using as a crypt?
# Notes
- Mr. Dittles trains with Pippy to switch his fight score with contacts
- Mr. Dittles tries to tell his friends about the portal he saw, but they are skeptical.
- Myla sides with Mr. Dittles about going back to the mines, and convinces Maritza.
- Io knows some lore about portals
- the group goes back to the mine entrance
- they identify a couple smaller, unguarded, entrances
- session end because ppl are tired
- mr dittles swaps out will and stealth
