# Prep

- In-Game Day: 10728-5-8
- we left off in the middle of a fight against a group of 5 rock monsters - Mr. Dittles took a big hit but we're retconning the damage to be spread throughout the group. Maritza hit one of them for iirc 2 damage which would actually take it out, bringing the group # down to 4
- cause of the elementals appearing - a small rift to another plane (not dnd style planes) has opened up somewhere in the mines.
- boosts & aspects in play from last session:
	- situational aspect: high explosives
	- situational aspect: myla has a rocket launcher
		- [x] free invoke
	- advantage/aspect: first aid kit
		- [ ] ENEMY gets a free invoke!

- if they can clear out the mines, the [Reeve of Townsend](../../People/Reeve%20of%20Townsend.md) will pay them a suitable reward
- the [Frost Shepherds](../../Factions/Frost%20Shepherds.md) will arrive on 10782-5-11 - they will have multiple hooks for the players to interact with (see [2025-03-11 - Cheesecake & Lies (Significant Milestone)](2025-03-11%20-%20Cheesecake%20&%20Lies%20(Significant%20Milestone).md))
- if they actually get into the mines somehow - they will find more monsters, but eventually, rift to... otherworld? fey realm? WORLDBUILDING
