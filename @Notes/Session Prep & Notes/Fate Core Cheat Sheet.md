## Teamwork
- when a character takes an action, other characters can assist if they have the same skill the primary character is using. Each assisting character adds a +1 bonus to the primary character's role.
- the assisting characters also absorb any consequences from the primary character's failure
	- this technically means that if a player fails at defending themself from an attack, other players can step in to "protect" them by absorbing some of the damage?
	- or do they have to declare that they're helping before the results are rolled?
		- OR is having to share the consequences enough of a trade-off to balance the benefit of reducing damage?

## Healing From Damage
### Stress
- Stress is automatically reset once the combat is over and the characters have time to rest
### Consequences
- To heal a consequence, succeed at an overcome action {using some skill} related to the healing process
	- Mild - Fair (+2) difficulty
	- Moderate - Great (+4) difficulty
	- Severe - Fantastic (+6) difficulty
- On a success, rename the consequence to reflect the healing process
- You can then remove the consequence & clear the slot after a certain amount of time has passed:
	- Mild - one scene after recovery action
	- Moderate - one session after recovery action
	- Severe - one scenario after recovery action
# Milestones 
## Minor
End of session
- Switch the rank values of any two ==skills==, or replace one Average (+1) skill with one that isn’t on your sheet.
- Change any single ==stunt== for another stunt.
- ==Purchase== a new stunt, provided you have the refresh to do so. (Remember, you can’t go below 1 refresh.)
- Rename one character ==aspect== that isn’t your high concept.
- rename any moderate ==consequences== you have, so that you can start them on the road to recovery, presuming you have not already done so.
## Significant Milestone
End of a scenario (i.e. a plot point; or every 2-3 sessions)
In addition to the benefit of a ==minor== milestone, you also gain both of the following:

- One additional ==skill== point, which you can spend to buy a new skill at Average (+1) or increase an existing skill by one rank.
- If you have any ==severe== consequences, you can rename them to begin the recovery process, if you haven’t already.
## Major Milestone
End of a story arc (something that shakes up the story; or around 3 scenarios/6-9 sessions)
Achieving a major milestone confers the benefits of a ==significant== milestone and a ==minor== milestone, and all of the following additional options:

- If you have an ==extreme== consequence, rename it to reflect that you’ve moved past its most debilitating effects. This allows you to take another extreme consequence in the future, if you desire.
- Take an additional point of ==refresh==, which allows you to immediately buy a new ==stunt== or keep it in order to give yourself more fate points at the beginning of a session.
- Advance a ==skill== beyond the campaign’s current skill ==cap==, if you’re able to, thus increasing the skill cap.
- ==Rename== your character’s high concept if you desire.
