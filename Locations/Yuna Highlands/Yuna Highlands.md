# Description 

## Thematic & Aesthetic Touchstones 
- Armenian highlands - cultural & political touchstone
- Cascades - climate touchstone
- Appalachia - climate touchstone
## Environment
Yuna has a subtropical highlands climate, a subset of the oceanic climate. rainfall is spread evenly throughout the year.

It is a large area with multiple subregions. 

Politically, much of the region has recently been united under a single ruler after a long period of conflict. 

In many areas, the local militia plays an important role in uniting people. this is a result of recent wars in which bandits and warlords fought for supremacy and settlements were often left to fend for themselves. Many believe that the military should have a bigger role in government due to their recently proven valor.

Much of the local populace is organized into extended families and clans.

# Wilderness

## Abandoned Jackals stronghold 

## Decrepit Structure

- Theruinisfallingapart,andisactivelydangeroustoits inhabitants. Navigating between areas may require careful progress, extensive rope and piton work, or avoidance of certain obvious-but-hazardous routes. Native inhabitants may have adapted to the hazards or they might be newcomers who are learning the hard way. Some areas in the ruin might provoke a general collapse if they are significantly damaged.
- E Outside plunderer with no care for the consequences, Outsider actively trying to destroy the place, Berserk native trying to repair things
- F Refugee forced to live there, Native dweller seeking help to fix things, Architectural researcher

- T Resources that can repair the damage, Precious loot that will destabilize the place if taken, Treasure revealed by a structural collapse
- P Creaking bridge or gantry, Room with numerous holes in the floor, Tower leaning at a drunken angle

## Abandoned Mine

- the villagers once used the upper levels as a crypt (for victims of disease?)

- a rubbing of the carvings adorns the wall of the Rogue and Tome
- lower levels of the mine connect to the underdark, but the entrance is barred

- Disused Mine
- A mine of some kind once existed here. While shaft mines with tunnels and galleries are the common type for present-day delvings, ancient strip mines here may have peeled off whole mountainsides or exposed some massive megastructure that was stripped for parts in a prior, lost age. The forgotten mines of a prior era might have left tailing piles or trace deposits that are valuable to a more depleted age.
- E Crazed wildcat miner, Thing from delving too deep, Undead and tireless mine boss
- F Eager prospector, Native dwelling in the mines, Ancient friendly mining automaton

- P Massive pitch-black subterranean gallery, Mound made of centuries worth of tailings, Still- poisoned land in a processing waste zone

  

## Beneath the Abandoned  Mines

- Hidden Within

- The ruin is actually underneath a seemingly-ordinary structure or inhabited human settlement. Secret passages or long-forgotten portals lead down into it, and only a short space away from ordinary human life a ruin can seethe with sinister secrets. The ruin may have been built over accidentally, intentionally buried, or perhaps excavated by the current structure’s original builders.
- E Thing that creeps up from below at night, Long- buried evil, Reckless adventurer stirring up things beneath
- F Passage-wise urchin, Architect with too much curiosity, Hapless local sewer worker

- P Passage hidden behind now-crumbling construction, Mundane room above a monstrous evil, Secret passages that have peepholes into the structure above

## Stargazing Spot

Uncanny Weather

- The area is affected by unnatural or magical weather conditions. It may be a pocket of snowy wasteland in a jungle, an area racked by cataclysmic storms, a shifted zone of space that overlaps with some alien world’s atmosphere, an area of perpetual balmy summer, or some other obvious anomaly. Natives may have figured out some way to exploit this condition, or it might be too dangerous for regular occupation.
- E Ruthless sorcerer bent on unlocking its secrets, Monstrous beast that thrives in the environment, Dangerous remnant of the zone’s creators

## Waterfall & Pond

- a merchant was murdered here, and popular wisdom says it was done by religious missionaries in order to keep him from revealing their secrets!
- Magical Springs
- There’s an enchanted spring in the area, one empowered by an ancient Working or warped by ambient currents of magic. The creatures that drink from it might be blessed with some special grace, but it’s just as likely that some more sinister consequence comes from imbibing its water. The animal and plant life around it have doubtless been substantially altered by its effects. Most such springwater loses its powers if separated from the main body for very long.
- E Beast warped by the spring’s power, Ruthless sorcerer experimenting with its effects, Barbaric chieftain using it to advance his power
- F Ancestral guardian of the spring, Pioneer plagued by the spring’s effects, Scholar who thinks they can fix any negative effects of the spring

## Fey Ruins

- fey creatures spotted in the area— actually miniature hummingbird birdfolk
- Lone tree in the center of the ruins marks the portal to the fey realm

- opening the portal involves eating the fruit of the tree that grows at the center of the ruins
- Hunter Jr. Can be found in the inn, where he will tell anyone about his experience im the ruins after a drink or two 

- the local people see it as a lure to the greedy and reckless
- it was destroyed by a great foe
- it hasn’t been plundered because of rumors of it’s fearsome inhabitants 
- it’s architecture resembles that of a known (past) civilization, and it was built around some kind of civil infrastructure that the civilization is known for
- bandits and smugglers have been known to use it as a hideout

## WWN Tags:

- Distant Gate

- The ruin is connected to some interesting distant location, either through a magical gate, a portal of ancient technology, forgotten tube-cars in underground tunnels, or a more mundane hidden passage into an otherwise inaccessible place. The natives may know about and exploit this quality, or the gate may be sealed until some particular procedure or object is used to activate it.
- Enemy: Guardian of the gate, Hostile entity from the other side, Intruder determined to unlock the gate
- Friend: Hapless intruder from the other side, Native gate-guide, Explorer seeking a route to the gate’s destination
- Complications: The gate is one-way. After passing through it, travelers must find another way out of the fey realm.
- Things: Key to activate the gate, Codes to control its destination, Treasure from the far side of it
- Places:: Mysterious transit-chamber with symbolism related to the destination, Room with objects or remains related to the destination, Dangerously energetic gate room

- Failed Intrusion

- The ruin recently experienced a serious incursion of outsiders, whether adventurers, bandits, government forces, angry villagers, or other hostiles. These intruders were repulsed, perhaps with significant loss of native life, and the ruin was considerably disrupted by the fighting. Important native leaders might have been killed or wounded, treasures might have been looted, or slaves and hostages might’ve been taken.
- Enemy: Desperate intruder leader still in the ruin, Bloodthirsty native leader craving vengeance, Dead leader’s heir full of terrible ideas
- Friend: Sympathetic intruder or native survivor, Escaped slave, Vengeful relative of the dead
- Complications: The intruders are too desperate to have entirely given up, The two sides basically ruined each other, Outsiders have entered to take advantage of the chaos
- Things: Useful relic lost by the intruding forces, Stolen treasure of the natives, Tribal treasure now inaccessible due to the chief’s death
- Places: Site of a hideous battle, Larder where the dead intruders are being kept, Local beast lair full of dragged corpses

- Lost City
- There was a city here once and its remnants can still be found through the overgrowth. It may have been an ancient city of some lost empire, or it could be a community more recently destroyed by some event and consumed by the surrounding wilderness. In the former case it’s probably forgotten by all but the wisest scholars, while in the latter there’s some pressing reason that its former people don’t dare approach its site any more.
- E The terrible creature that destroyed it, Vengeful wraith of its last ruler, Savage chieftain who’s taken it for his seat of rule
- F Shy survivor of the original population, Local native who dares to enter it, Ancient city servitor who still functions
- C The city is plagued with magical aftershocks of the mighty sorcery that destroyed it, The city was smashed before its inhabitants could do a great evil, It’s taboo ground for the nearby locals
- T Ancient city vault’s treasures, Precious relic of the dead, Fragment of the thing that ruined it
- P Desolate street half-buried by earth and decay, City monument worn into illegibility, Wreckage of the catastrophic death of the city
