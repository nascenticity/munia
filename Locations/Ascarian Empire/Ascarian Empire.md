- inspired by Roman, Byzantine and Persian empires - traditional fantasy setting but with a *twist*

# History 
- A little over 500 years ago,  founder [Ascarion I](../../People/Ascarion%20I.md) slayed an ancient dragon at [Mount Dagor](Mount%20Dagor.md) and used the wealth from its hoard to found a great kingdom, from which his descendants went on to conquer the entire region 

# Government
- Divinely ordained emperor
- Persian-style fealty system (satrapy)? with conquered kingdoms retaining a degree of cultural independence but ultimately loyal to the emperor
