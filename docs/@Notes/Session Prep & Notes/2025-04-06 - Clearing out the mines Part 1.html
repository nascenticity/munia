    Prep

<p>
    The scenario: 
- It's been about a week since the events in the mines. Since then, nobody has been able to enter. 
- One group tried, and was quickly repelled by the creatures with a few moderate (but no life-threatening) injuries. 
- As a result, a messenger was sent to the nearby city of Naven to get help, which is expected to arrive soon. 
- In the meantime, the many out of work miners are concerned for their livelihoods. 
- There have been offerings made to the fey of the forest, and even a small faction who thinks the invasion of monsters is a sign that the mines should never have been opened in the first place, and will resist efforts to drive the creatures out.
- When the Naven mages arrive, they will perform a ritual as described in previous notes
    - Need stats for mages
    - the ritual gets its own note
    - random names for townsfolk would be a good idea
   </p>

    The characters:
- Last session,
    <a href="../../Player%20Characters/Mr.%20Dittles.html">
     Mr. Dittles
    </a>
    fell for
    <a href="../../Player%20Characters/Maritza%20Reddington.html">
     Maritza
    </a>
    's lie that this isn't his stolen ship. So now, what's his new motivation for staying with the party. I don't doubt that Sunny will play along, but what's next for the character?
- What does
    <a href="../../Player%20Characters/Myla.html">
     Myla
    </a>
    do when she can't get into the mines?
- Maritza might need more coal before she can leave town. She COULD pay market price... which has suddenly gone way up. Or she could help get to the bottom of the situation in the mines.
