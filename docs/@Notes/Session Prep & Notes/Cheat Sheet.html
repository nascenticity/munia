<h2>
    Teamwork
   </h2>
<ul>
<li>
     when a character takes an action, other characters can assist if they have the same skill the primary character is using. Each assisting character adds a +1 bonus to the primary character's role.
    </li>
<li>
     the assisting characters also absorb any consequences from the primary character's failure
     <ul>
<li>
       this technically means that if a player fails at defending themself from an attack, other players can step in to "protect" them by absorbing some of the damage?
      </li>
<li>
       or do they have to declare that they're helping before the results are rolled?
       <ul>
<li>
         OR is having to share the consequences enough of a trade-off to balance the benefit of reducing damage?
        </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Healing From Damage
   </h2>
<h3>
    Stress
   </h3>
<ul>
<li>
     Stress is automatically reset once the combat is over and the characters have time to rest
    </li>
</ul>
<h3>
    Consequences
   </h3>
<ul>
<li>
     To heal a consequence, succeed at an overcome action related to the healing process
     <ul>
<li>
       Mild - Fair (+2) difficulty
      </li>
<li>
       Moderate - Great (+4) difficulty
      </li>
<li>
       Severe - Fantastic (+6) difficulty
      </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
     On a success, rename the consequence to reflect the healing process
    </li>
<li>
     You can then remove the consequence &amp; clear the slot after a certain amount of time has passed:
     <ul>
<li>
       Mild - one scene after recovery action
      </li>
<li>
       Moderate - one session after recovery action
      </li>
<li>
       Severe - one scenario after recovery action
      </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<h1>
    Milestones
   </h1>
<h2>
    Minor
   </h2>
<p>
    End of session
- Switch the rank values of any two ==skills==, or replace one Average (+1) skill with one that isn’t on your sheet.
- Change any single ==stunt== for another stunt.
- ==Purchase== a new stunt, provided you have the refresh to do so. (Remember, you can’t go below 1 refresh.)
- Rename one character ==aspect== that isn’t your high concept.
- rename any moderate ==consequences== you have, so that you can start them on the road to recovery, presuming you have not already done so.
   </p>
<h2>
    Significant Milestone
   </h2>
<p>
    End of a scenario (i.e. a plot point; or every 2-3 sessions)
In addition to the benefit of a ==minor== milestone, you also gain both of the following:
   </p>
<ul>
<li>
     One additional ==skill== point, which you can spend to buy a new skill at Average (+1) or increase an existing skill by one rank.
    </li>
<li>
     If you have any ==severe== consequences, you can rename them to begin the recovery process, if you haven’t already.
    </li>
</ul>
<h2>
    Major Milestone
   </h2>
<p>
    End of a story arc (something that shakes up the story; or around 3 scenarios/6-9 sessions)
Achieving a major milestone confers the benefits of a ==significant== milestone and a ==minor== milestone, and all of the following additional options:
   </p>
<ul>
<li>
     If you have an ==extreme== consequence, rename it to reflect that you’ve moved past its most debilitating effects. This allows you to take another extreme consequence in the future, if you desire.
    </li>
<li>
     Take an additional point of ==refresh==, which allows you to immediately buy a new ==stunt== or keep it in order to give yourself more fate points at the beginning of a session.
    </li>
<li>
     Advance a ==skill== beyond the campaign’s current skill ==cap==, if you’re able to, thus increasing the skill cap.
    </li>
<li>
     ==Rename== your character’s high concept if you desire.
    </li>
</ul>
