   <pre><code>Kragsunder &amp; Daughter Trade Caravan
    Of the many trade caravans that make the journey in and out of Cameste's territory, 
    Description and Cast
        Farms along the Banquet River supply much of the food and basic material nees for the nearby cities. Caravans ply the roads and waterways carrying goods and coin -- making them a ripe target for plunder.

        Arza Kragsunder(she/her) -- dwarven merchant, caravan leader
        Merchant caravan sidekick
        Bruna Kragsunder (she/her) -- Arza's young adult daughter, will take over the business once Arza retires

        Stakes:
            Will the caravan and its goods make it safely to market?
            Will the characters get a taste for adventure and forge on together?

    Danger:


Feudal Alliances around the Azure Sea

    Description and Cast:
        A century ago, the Goddess Camestia carved out the [Pelagian Strait](Pelagian%20Strait.html) and raised an island from the depths. When she led her children to settle there, they built a grand city and named it in her honor. Since then, Cameste has become part of the loose network of alliances and trade that defines the western Azure Sea.

            Luminate Merelle (she/her), leader of the Church of Camestia (a reformer, wants to curb the Church's power &amp; increase democracy)
            Watch Captain Nerai (they/them) (feels under-staffed and lacking resources)

    Stakes:
        What is the status of non-Pelagians in Cameste and territory controlled by the church?
        How is the government of Cameste organized?
        Does Cameste remain a free and independent port?
        Will Cameste expand its territory and infringe on other powers?

    Danger: Corrupt Church Officials
        Loyal to the late Luminate Cyreus, a faction of power-seeking priests opposes the new leader of Camestia's followers, Merelle.
    Ambitious Organization: Corrupt Government
    Impulse: To maintain the Status Quo
    Portents:
        Non-Pelagians are banned from the clergy
        The city council is dissolved
    Impending Doom: Tyrany -- absolute rule by the church

    Danger: Foreign Investors
        Cameste is in a backwater, but some see its potential as a new hub for global trade networks. Not content to stand on the sidelines, a few shrewd business magnates seek to cut themselves a slice of the Camestian pie.
    Ambitious Organization: Cabal
    Impulse: To absorb those in power, to grow
    Portents:
    Impending doom: Usurpation -- outside powers will colonize the city.

    Danger: Artas, God of Nature
        Nature resists the attempts of people to tame, control, or restrain it. 
    Planar Force: Force of Chaos
    Impulse: to destroy all semblance of order
    Portents:
    Impending doom: Destruction -- the end of Cameste and of Pelagian civilization
