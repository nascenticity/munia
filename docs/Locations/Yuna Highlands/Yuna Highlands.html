<h2>
    Environment
   </h2>
<p>
    Yuna has a subtropical highlands climate, a subset of the oceanic climate. rainfall is spread evenly throughout the year.
   </p>
<p>
    It is a large area with multiple subregions.
   </p>
<p>
    Politically, much of the region has recently been united under a single ruler after a long period of conflict.
   </p>
<p>
    In many areas, the local militia plays an important role in uniting people. this is a result of recent wars in which bandits and warlords fought for supremacy and settlements were often left to fend for themselves. Many believe that the military should have a bigger role in government due to their recently proven valor.
   </p>
<p>
    Much of the local populace is organized into extended families and clans.

      The ruin is actually underneath a seemingly-ordinary structure or inhabited human settlement. Secret passages or long-forgotten portals lead down into it, and only a short space away from ordinary human life a ruin can seethe with sinister secrets. The ruin may have been built over accidentally, intentionally buried, or perhaps excavated by the current structure’s original builders.

     The area is affected by unnatural or magical weather conditions. It may be a pocket of snowy wasteland in a jungle, an area racked by cataclysmic storms, a shifted zone of space that overlaps with some alien world’s atmosphere, an area of perpetual balmy summer, or some other obvious anomaly. Natives may have figured out some way to exploit this condition, or it might be too dangerous for regular occupation.

    </li>
<li>
     There’s an enchanted spring in the area, one empowered by an ancient Working or warped by ambient currents of magic. The creatures that drink from it might be blessed with some special grace, but it’s just as likely that some more sinister consequence comes from imbibing its water. The animal and plant life around it have doubtless been substantially altered by its effects. Most such springwater loses its powers if separated from the main body for very long.

      Distant Gate
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
      The ruin is connected to some interesting distant location, either through a magical gate, a portal of ancient technology, forgotten tube-cars in underground tunnels, or a more mundane hidden passage into an otherwise inaccessible place. The natives may know about and exploit this quality, or the gate may be sealed until some particular procedure or object is used to activate it.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
     Enemy: Guardian of the gate, Hostile entity from the other side, Intruder determined to unlock the gate
    </li>
<li>
     Friend: Hapless intruder from the other side, Native gate-guide, Explorer seeking a route to the gate’s destination
    </li>
<li>
     Complications: The gate is one-way. After passing through it, travelers must find another way out of the fey realm.
    </li>
<li>
     Things: Key to activate the gate, Codes to control its destination, Treasure from the far side of it
    </li>
<li>
<p>
      Places:: Mysterious transit-chamber with symbolism related to the destination, Room with objects or remains related to the destination, Dangerously energetic gate room

<p>
      Failed Intrusion
     </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>
      The ruin recently experienced a serious incursion of outsiders, whether adventurers, bandits, government forces, angry villagers, or other hostiles. These intruders were repulsed, perhaps with significant loss of native life, and the ruin was considerably disrupted by the fighting. Important native leaders might have been killed or wounded, treasures might have been looted, or slaves and hostages might’ve been taken.
     </p>
</li>
<li>
     Enemy: Desperate intruder leader still in the ruin, Bloodthirsty native leader craving vengeance, Dead leader’s heir full of terrible ideas
    </li>
<li>
     Friend: Sympathetic intruder or native survivor, Escaped slave, Vengeful relative of the dead
    </li>
<li>
     Complications: The intruders are too desperate to have entirely given up, The two sides basically ruined each other, Outsiders have entered to take advantage of the chaos
    </li>
<li>
     Things: Useful relic lost by the intruding forces, Stolen treasure of the natives, Tribal treasure now inaccessible due to the chief’s death
    </li>
<li>
<p>
      Places: Site of a hideous battle, Larder where the dead intruders are being kept, Local beast lair full of dragged corpses

      Lost City
     </p>
</li>
<li>
     There was a city here once and its remnants can still be found through the overgrowth. It may have been an ancient city of some lost empire, or it could be a community more recently destroyed by some event and consumed by the surrounding wilderness. In the former case it’s probably forgotten by all but the wisest scholars, while in the latter there’s some pressing reason that its former people don’t dare approach its site any more.
