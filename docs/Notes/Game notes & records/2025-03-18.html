    The scenario: It's been about a week since the events in the mines. Since then, nobody has been able to enter. One group tried, and was quickly repelled by the creatures with a few serious (but no life-threatening) injuries. As a result, a messenger was sent to the nearby city of Naven to get help, which is expected to arrive soon. In the meantime, the many out of work miners are concerned for their livelihoods. There have been offerings made to the fey of the forest, and even a small faction who thinks the invasion of monsters is a sign that the mines should never have been opened in the first place, and will resist efforts to drive the creatures out.

     Maritza might need more coal before she can leave town. She COULD pay market price... which has suddenly gone way up. Or she could help get to the bottom of the situation in the mines.
