    <p>
     Nameless NPCs come in three varieties:
     <strong>
      Average
     </strong>
     ,
     <strong>
      Fair
     </strong>
     , and
     <strong>
      Good
     </strong>
     .
    </p>
    <h4>
     Average
     <a href="https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/creating-and-playing-opposition#average">
     </a>
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Competence
      </strong>
      : Rank-and-file order-takers, local conscripts, and the like. When in doubt, a nameless NPC is Average.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Purpose
      </strong>
      : Mostly there to make the PCs look more awesome.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Aspects
      </strong>
      : One or two.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Skills
      </strong>
      : One or two Average (+1).
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Stress
      </strong>
      : No stress boxes—a one shift hit is enough to take them out.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     Fair
     <a href="https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/creating-and-playing-opposition#fair">
     </a>
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Competence
      </strong>
      : Trained professionals, like soldiers and elite guards, or others whose role in the scene speaks to their experience, such as a sharp-tongued courtier or talented thief.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Purpose
      </strong>
      : Drain a few of the players’ resources (one or two fate points, stress boxes, possibly a mild consequence).
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Aspects
      </strong>
      : One or two.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Skills
      </strong>
      : One Fair (+2), and one or two Average (+1).
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Stress:
      </strong>
      One stress box (e.g. 1[ ])—a two shift hit is enough to take them out.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     Good
     <a href="https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/creating-and-playing-opposition#good">
     </a>
    </h4>
    <ul>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Competence
      </strong>
      : Tough opposition, especially in numbers.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Purpose
      </strong>
      : Drain the players’ resources—as Fair, but more so. Provide a decent stumbling block (in numbers) on the way to a more significant encounter.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Aspects
      </strong>
      : One or two.
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Skills
      </strong>
      : One Good (+3), one Fair (+2), and one or two Average (+1).
     </li>
     <li>
      <strong>
       Stress
      </strong>
      : Two stress boxes (e.g. 1[ ], 2[ ])—a three shift hit is enough to take them out.
     </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>
     Mobs
     <a href="https://fate-srd.com/fate-core/creating-and-playing-opposition#mobs">
     </a>
    </h4>
    <p>
     Whenever possible, identical nameless NPCs like to form groups, or mobs. Not only does this better ensure their survival, it reduces the workload on the GM. For all intents and purposes, you can treat a mob as a single unit—instead of rolling dice individually for each of three thugs, just roll once for the whole mob.
