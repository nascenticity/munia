    Where we left off: “standoff” between
    <a href="../../Player%20Characters/Maritza%20Reddington.html">
     Maritza
    </a>
    ,
    <a href="../../Player%20Characters/Myla.html">
     Myla
    </a>
    , and
    <a href="../../Player%20Characters/Mr.%20Dittles.html">

    in the mine
   </p>
<p>
    What happens next: some kind of interruption that forces them to team up - monster attack? cave in? something else? cave in
    <em>
     caused
    </em>
    by a monster?] force them to work together 
- the mine is full of earth elementals, something has woken them up. characters must escape from the mines (elementals’ ultimate goal is to claim the mines or themselves - but a lot can happen)
    - escape scenario: it’s dark, close quarters, and the layout is confusing 
    - combat scenario: the elementals’ goal is more to scare than to harm, and they will let enemies retreat, but they will defend what they see as their territory
- mines are closed as a result — poor myla can’t mine, and maritza will need to find a new fuel supplier…
- future conflict - disruption to the town’s economy
   </p>
<p>
    end goal: characters emerge as an establishment team — likely, dittles wants to follow maritza till he can get “his” airship back; myla might want more of those weird crystals
