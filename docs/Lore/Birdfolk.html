<p>
     there is no such thing as an assigned gender/sex at birth. chicks choose their own genders when theyre old enough. much like irl birds, its incredibly hard to tell what the sex at birth is. even if a birdfolk lays an egg during puberty, they are regarded as the gender they say they are. ie: maritza's son biscuit (12 years old) laid an egg and began puberty in the last year, but is still a boy and her son. her 8 year old daughter, io, has yet to go through puberty, so her sex at birth is unknown, and will be unknown until she lays an egg, which may never happen. io is still a girl and maritza's daughter, and even if she never lays an egg, she is still a girl.

<p>
     as a result, the concept of 'being trans' is foreign to birdfolk, since theyre so used to everyone just picking a gender and changing it when they feel like it. they are very accepting of other species that change gender and pronouns.
