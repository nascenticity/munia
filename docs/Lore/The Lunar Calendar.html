   The Lunar Calendar

<p>
    The primary timekeeping system on Munia used by scholars and international groups is the lunar calendar based on the planet's two moons - Enes and Camestia. Because the moons are in a 1:3 resonance with each other, the orbit of Enes is 3x shorter than that of Camestia. Thus in a 12-month calendar when Enes experiences 12 cycles, Camestia only experiences four. This helpfully divides up the year into twelve months, and four quarters of three months each.

    The precision of their orbital alignments has led Enes and Camestia, as deities, to be worshiped as patrons of mathematics and the sciences.
