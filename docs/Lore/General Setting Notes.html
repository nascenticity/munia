    THEMES
   </h2>
<ol>
<li>
     High magic - the world is full of wonders, monsters are an ever present threat, and the gods have an active role in shaping the world according to their own motivations
    </li>
<li>
     Diversity - a number of intelligent species inhabit the world, with overlapping histories and cultures and an broad range of perspectives
    </li>
<li>
     on a planet with multiple intelligent species, it makes sense for each species to develop its own “niche” in an ecological sense - humans prefer grasslands and river valleys, dwarves prefer subterranean environments, etc.
    </li>
<li>
     Natural forces - nature is a powerful force, holding its own thru wild magic and powers agents acting on its behalf against the encroachment of exploitative entities
    </li>
<li>
     Time is long - due to the presence of the gods and the existence of long lived species such as elves, historical records extend far back into the past, well beyond what exists in our own world
